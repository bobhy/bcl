# Contributing

## The Credo
(as in [_credo quia absurdum_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credo_quia_absurdum))

We eagerly welcome contributors to this project who sign up to this:
* We're willing to work on a project that will never pay us a dime.
* We acknowlege the dual role of art and physics in this project, and understand that both will play a role in resolving disagreements that may come up[^1].  We agree to argue responsibly, to stick to objective reality and avoid _ad-hominem_ digressions.
* We buy into [the vision](#the-vision-statement)

## The Vision Statement

**TBD**

## Status
I intend this project to start from a complete functional and conceptual spec.  That's what I was best at in professional software development experience, I think I can capture the essential concepts in black and white and subject them to objective review and refinement, and that would be great guidance during the implementation and long-term maintenance phases.

But, at the moment, the spec is only a few paragraphs.  I'd particularly appreciate collaborators who are willing to participate in extensive spec-wrangling.  I'm not averse to code examples and proof of concept, but not ready to dive in and write a bunch of code ATM. 

# Tools and coding style
The code is colloquial, hopefully ergonometric Rust.  

We will prefer to use `cargo` and `rustup` toolchains and only replace them if they're hopelessly inadequate for the job.


We will use `rustfmt` and `cargo clippy` and minimize file-specific rules overrides.
